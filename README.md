discover
========

Discover is a utility to aid in conceptualizing large Go code bases.
It is based on the idea presented by Alan Shreve in his talk on
conceptualizing large software systems, held at dotGo 2015 in Paris.

It does this by taking a code coverage profile generated by "go test"
and using it to trim the source code down to the blocks that were
actually being run.

Installation
------------

Simply run `go get github.com/eandre/discover/...`

Examples
--------

#### Run tests and output to console
`discover test`

#### Run a single test and output to console
`discover test TestMyTestName`

#### Run all tests starting with "TestFoo"
`discover test TestFoo`

#### Run all tests and write the output to ./foo
`discover -output=./foo test`

#### Parse an existing cover profile and write the output to ./foo
`discover -output=./foo parse my-cover-profile.cov`

Tips
----

If you want to track changes between two tests, write the output to a directory,
and then use `git` to track the changes:

```
# Run first test
discover -output=/tmp/example test TestFirst
cd /tmp/example
git init && git add -A && git commit -m "First"
cd -

# Run second test
discover -output=/tmp/example test TestSecond
cd /tmp/example
git diff
```
